    <h1>Glimpse of 2k23</h1>
    <p>
      04 Dec 2023 Final Goodbye Thank God... This year finally comes to an end.... A lot of misadventures... I would rather say misfortunes happened this year... But ALHAMDULILLAH with help of all of you guys, I've made it so far...
      I've spent years
with all of you except one person here.... Starting offfrom playing tennis with injured foot and wrist without
my own racket.. unable to defend my title.. and a bloody idiot was officerin charge who took away allthe
things without even thinking.... Breaking nose ( stillfeel sorry and my hand hurtsü´∂)... Then worked for years
for a single prize and Da Fauq, whole event was cancelled.... Chill in board exams was worth enjoying...
Giving whole board exam without even reading whole syllabus and anotherlvl of craze... I don't have enough
space for mentioning all college events.. you guys know yourroles .. esp Table Tennisüèì Long hours in the
Ante room just playing Table Tennis... Those late night birthday parties.... And most of you used to say why u
sleep early it's bcoz I used to wake up in the middle of night... it's a good habit to survive difficult
circumstances IFYKYK... btw I still sleep early and wake up in the middle of night... most ofthe time I don't
even have to sleep early... I wake up after sleep for an hour ortwo .. I have become Batman ( Thanks to your
TraumaDear)... Well leave it...Nothing ofthat gonna happen Again... ever...Then Chill during ISSB and chaprii
ü§°entries at CMB were worth enjoying... Played PUBG with some of you late at night and chatting with you at
midnight was worth it.... Then came the biggest chutiyapa ofthe decade aka Low merit Cases... btw let me
make one thing clear.... Our names were on that list.... we were removed later on due to some reason.
. I
called an AVM forthe same reason..coz I already knew it that my name was on that list but it was too late... he
said that " Beta I can get you the joining letter but issue is you are telling me late I might not be able to get aOne
forGDP... btw plz don't quote any ofthese... its confidential... Then I said ok sirI'll waitforthe next Course but
this time I'll get it by unfair means I really don't care... Our college did the most shit thing ever.... the idiotic
politics and Conspiracies among the faculty members have ruined ourfuture and IfI reached the top.... the
college won't be there anymore... Let's change the topic it's getting boring... Btw again the tourto Grw aka
Sargodha 2.0 was fun... better both of you start calling me papa.... Visiting the college there... It isn't as big
and beautiful as it seemed to be.. but yeah Apex clg Grw... Enjoyed the visit....Love and respect to all of you
guys... All of you will always be respected.... My chapter might ends here but continue your stories without
me.... Btw I met many new faces while going forIssb and different tests and you... Only you are worthy to be
remembered ( even though you made yourself worthless orthink of yourself worthless but I honoured you
with my prayers that was the best thing I could do) and you Will be and ireally enjoyed the company... Thanks
for your worthy time... You taught me the biggest lesson of my life.
.Never Lower your standards forAnyone
and I did itfor you... Love to all of you... Yeah some of you left.. mjy pata ha tum logo ki b majburithitumko
jana tha but u left me at my lowest when i was having an extreme emotional breakdown... I needed you
people but you chose to leave . No guiltfeelfree to ask me for help I won't leave..If you find yourself
mentioned in this story then you are worthy ofthis.. Find your part which one is for you.... This is First and
last time I'm doing this... If you wanna say something or ask you can in next story.. I'm Giving Up üòîmost of
you won't find me anymore, anywhere.... Considerit a last goodbye from me... I might even seize to exist...
Shine of you may ask what happened, things a lot more worse than just mentioned... Conor must be
wondering Why I mentioned him... Here is your part bro... You literally did the most useless shit everthat
day.... You didn't even think of saying goodbye... Not a problem I know it was a difficult time for you.. yeah
no issue but keep in mind... You'll find a loyal person very rarely and hypocrites are everywhere so plz be
careful out there .... Love to all of you ü´∂
Yr ma aisi cheezain nai krta... but this yearI've been most active socially... so I'm doing it .... Agr kisi na koi
gaali deni ha ya kuch poochna btana ha tw pehli dafaQnA krrha hu aur yeh aakhri dafa b ha tw tmhari mrzi
waha krlena..
